Here are all of my Team Fortress 2 scripts for your use. They are all published under the MIT license and all documentation is inside each script.
Utility is where all of my general scripts are stored.
Classes are where all my of class-specific scripts are stored (missing Soldier and Demoman because I can't think of any scripts that I can even make for them that would be remotely useful).
